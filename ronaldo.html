            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; text-align: left;">Cristiano Ronaldo is often cited as the epitome of a modern athlete, a physical specimen whose dedication to training is legendary. While known for his powerful kicks, his most awe-inspiring feat is his vertical leap. He seems to hang in the air, defying gravity. This ability isn't magic; it's the result of a perfectly honed physique, optimized through a deep understanding of biomechanics and physiology.</p>

            <h3>The Anatomy of a Leap</h3>
            <p>A powerful jump is a full-body explosion, much like coiling and releasing a spring. It starts with the "powerhouse" muscles—the glutes, quads, and hamstrings—which generate the initial force. This force is then amplified by the calves and stabilized by a strong core. Ronaldo's training focuses on plyometrics, exercises that train the muscles to produce maximum force in minimum time, perfecting this explosive sequence.</p>

            <h3>Body Composition Analysis</h3>
            <p>To maximize his power-to-weight ratio, Ronaldo maintains an incredibly low body fat percentage. This isn't achieved by guesswork. Elite athletes use technologies like DEXA scans (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry), which provide a precise, medical-grade breakdown of bone density, fat mass, and lean muscle mass. This data allows his nutritionists and trainers to make tiny adjustments to his diet and workouts to keep his body in its optimal, peak-performance state.</p>

            <h3>Isokinetic Strength Training</h3>
            <p>This is like "smart" weight training. Instead of lifting a fixed weight, Ronaldo uses isokinetic machines that are engineered to provide consistent resistance through the entire range of motion. A computer controls the speed of movement, forcing the muscles to work at their maximum capacity at every point in the exercise. This is a highly efficient and safe way to build explosive strength without putting unnecessary strain on the joints.</p>

      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        BioMech is a passion project by a future Bioengineering major. It deconstructs elite athletes not just as players, but as high-performance biological systems, exploring how principles of mechanical engineering, materials science, and biotechnology are applied to push the boundaries of human potential.
