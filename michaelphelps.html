            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; text-align: left;">With 28 Olympic medals, Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian in history. His dominance in the pool wasn't just due to his incredible work ethic; it was also the result of a unique set of physiological gifts. His body is almost perfectly engineered for swimming, giving him a significant biomechanical advantage before he even touches the water.</p>

            <h3>A Body Built for Swimming</h3>
            <p>Anthropometry is the scientific study of the measurements and proportions of the human body. Phelps possesses several traits that are ideal for swimming. He has a disproportionately long torso and shorter legs, which reduces drag and helps him glide through the water. His massive wingspan (the length from one fingertip to the other) is greater than his height, creating powerful levers to pull himself through the water with each stroke.</p>

            <h3>Lactate Metabolism</h3>
            <p>During intense exercise, muscles produce lactic acid, which leads to fatigue. It has been reported that Phelps' body produces significantly less lactic acid than his competitors. This allows his muscles to perform at a peak level for longer periods and enables him to recover much more quickly between events—a crucial advantage in the Olympics, where he often had to swim multiple races in a single day.</p>

            <h3>Hypermobility and Flexibility</h3>
            <p>Phelps is known to have hypermobile joints, particularly in his ankles. This allows him to have an incredible range of motion, essentially turning his large feet into powerful flippers. This extreme flexibility increases the surface area of his feet during his kick, allowing him to push more water and generate greater propulsion with every movement.</p>

      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        BioMech is a passion project by a future Bioengineering major. It deconstructs elite athletes not just as players, but as high-performance biological systems, exploring how principles of mechanical engineering, materials science, and biotechnology are applied to push the boundaries of human potential.
