            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; text-align: left;">Muhammad Ali wasn't just a boxer; he was a phenomenon who revolutionized the sport. His famous quote, "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee," was a perfect description of his style, which was built on a foundation of superior speed, reflexes, and coordination. His abilities were not just physical; they were a showcase of a highly-tuned nervous system and an intuitive understanding of physics.</p>

            <h3>The Neuroscience of Reflexes</h3>
            <p>Ali's ability to dodge punches was legendary. This skill relied on an elite simple reaction time (SRT). The process involves the eyes detecting the opponent's movement, sending a signal to the brain, which processes the threat and sends a signal back to the muscles to react. Through thousands of hours of training, Ali's neural pathways for this process became incredibly efficient, allowing him to see, process, and evade a punch in a fraction of a second.</p>

            <h3>Proprioception: The Sixth Sense</h3>
            <p>The "Ali Shuffle" and his unique footwork were possible because of a superior sense of proprioception—the body's ability to sense its own position in space. Receptors in his muscles and joints constantly sent information to his brain, giving him an internal 3D map of his body. This allowed him to maintain perfect balance and coordination while moving in unconventional ways, making him an unpredictable and elusive target.</p>

            <h3>Stinging Like a Bee</h3>
            <p>Ali's punches were famously fast and precise. The power of a punch isn't just about arm strength; it's about impulse—the change in momentum. By snapping his punches with incredible speed, he minimized the time of impact. According to the impulse-momentum theorem (Force x time = change in momentum), decreasing the impact time while keeping the change in momentum constant dramatically increases the peak force delivered to the opponent, creating the "sting" he was famous for.</p>

      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        BioMech is a passion project by a future Bioengineering major. It deconstructs elite athletes not just as players, but as high-performance biological systems, exploring how principles of mechanical engineering, materials science, and biotechnology are applied to push the boundaries of human potential.
